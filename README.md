<h1>Hello, I’m @Noobhackeryt1</h1>
<p>I’m interested in coding - Html, CSS and JavaScript and making websites!</p>
<p>I’m currently learning JavaScript and refreshing my memory on html,css and js because I stopped coding for a few months.</p>
<p>I’m looking to collaborate on a game website</p>
<p>If you want to reach me send me a message on Github (if you can), or email me at "noobhackeryt1@gmail.com" It may take me a bit of time to respond.</p>
Didn't know I could code on here
